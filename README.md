# Hangman-in-C

A Hangman Game using C
The project was done by three undergraduate CS students in their first year, so it's not that logically high-end.
The program was developed using the TurboC compiler due to requirements of needing to program in the C language and the need to use the graphics.h header file. 
graphics.h is not supported by other compilers, so this project works only on the TurboC compiler

The project uses basic C concepts like loops, functions, structures, arrays, pointers and file-handling, including graphics.
It has a variety of features like:
Different topics to choose from
Leaderboard
A scoring mechanism based on the word
Provision to add new words to the dataset
and a nice stick figure Hangman :)

Check it out if you're interested :)

To try the game out, do the following:
Have the TurboC compiler installed in your computer.
Paste the Hangman-Final into the "Projects" folder of your TURBOC3 folder
Paste the text files into the "bin" folder of your TURBOC3 folder
Open the C file using TurboC, and hit compile and run! 

Have fun!!
